        These are some of the projects I have worked on. My most recent work is unfortunately protected by NDAs and
        hence cannot be published but please contact me personally and I would be happy to go over anything that is not

        <h1>Mehu</h1>
        <p>
          Mehu is a mobile app focusing on making the transition of waiting in line to getting a haircut faster, easier
          and convenient. The founder has a vision where clients could get in line for a haircut electronically and be
          free to do other stuff while they were waiting in line. It is also a platform where up and coming stylists and
          artists (hair, makeup, tattoo etc) working out of their homes could have access to new clients.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before I joined the project, the mobile app had all the aforementioned capabilities however, there were not as
          many stylists using the platform as expected and clients had complained about the app being inefficient and
          hard to use.
        </p>
        <p>
          My role in this project was not only to design the screens for the mobile app but also to facilitate
          conversations between the <b>Business and Development</b> sides of the project. In addition, I helped shape
          some of the Business goals for the new release.

          <h1>PuStack</h1>
          <p>
            PuStack was already an idea that was gaining momentum on YouTube before I became involved. Two friends and I
            started working on this idea further for a class. We didnâ€™t anticipate how far this idea would go and
            started working on making it a full product offering.
          </p>
          <p>
            When we started working on this idea for the class, PuStack was a YouTube channel where Indian students
            trying to study for their CBSE Board exams would come to learn and that was it. As we started working on
            this project, we came up with a
            <b>logo, user-flows, paper prototypes and a small but functional prototype</b> in the form of a web
            application.
          </p>
          <p>
            The last I was involved in this project, we were trying to hire some full-time employees so that we could
            make an Android app to capture the young student population that have access to smartphones.

        <h1>Microsoft GDS</h1>
        <p>
          While interning at Microsoft GDS in Hyderabad, I was tasked in making designs for a C2C application which had
          more than 10 nested levels of information that needed to be displayed in a tabular form in a web application
          and a mobile app. The current designs at that point were not able to display the levels and the hierarchy in a
          user-friendly fashion and the clients were not happy with the many different designs the team had already
          presented.
        </p>
        <p>
          My primary role here was to be a designer and come up with UI that was able to capture the nested level
          hierarchy as well as show the tabular information associated with selected level in the tree. I researched
          many different ways and settled on a multi-level menu or a treeview.
        </p>
        <p>
          A live demo was required for this project, so after I designed the web application and mobile screens, another
          developer and I wrote the code for these designs using HTML5/CSS3, jQuery, JavaScript ES5 and a plug-in called
          DLMenu. The code was handed over to the clients and our manager at that time relayed the client's very
          positive feedback to us.
